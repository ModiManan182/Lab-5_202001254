**General Analysis and understanding of error form ststis analysis:**<br>
There aren't many mistakes in the source you've chosen. Some mistakes are caused by importing 
inaccessible files, while others are caused by the variable name being used without being specified. 
Some mistakes are also caused by incorrect grammar.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned mistakes may not be displayed by a compiler, instead displaying a generic 
error notice that the user may not comprehend.<br>
Along with the mistakes listed above, there are some warnings. Some of the alerts were caused by 
unused 'else' lines and variables. Few were due to incorrect spacing, and a few were due to useless 
imported variables.<br>
The programme detects the majority of the cautions listed above. Additionally, some errors or cautions that are displayed by the static analysis utility as errors or false 
positives may not actually be errors.<br>
The static analysis led to the bulk of errors and alerts being found.
